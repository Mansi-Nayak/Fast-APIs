"""
This script defines two Pydantic models: Address and Patient.
It demonstrates how to nest one model (Address) within another (Patient).
The models validate and serialize structured data using type annotations.
An Address instance is created using a dictionary of values.
A Patient instance is then created using that Address object.
Finally, it accesses and prints the type of the model's dump method.

# Better organization of related data (e.g., vitals, address, insurance)

# Reusability: Use Vitals in multiple models (e.g., Patient, MedicalRecord)

# Readability: Easier for developers and API consumers to understand

# Validation: Nested models are validated automaticallyâ€”no extra work needed
